## Amazon Prime Video 1080p

A Chrome Extension that forces 1080p resolution for videos on Amazon Prime Video to be applied



## How does it work?
The script loaded on Amazon Prime Video determines the quality of the video by the size of the browser window, so it just rewrites it on page load.

Rewrites the Media Presentation Description (MPD) used for video streaming and replaces it with the highest quality video.

#### Note: I have done a lot of research on the problem of not being able to play HD videos on Linux, but have not found a solution.

## Information
So far, not sure if the script will work on amazon.com.
So If you are someone who can edit the source code, try that yourself please.

Also, I accept issues, so please feel free to open an issue!

## Check

- Not all videos on Amazon Prime Video are 1080p. Some of the original videos themselves are 720p (not 1080p), in which case they are HD.

- If the video is not in 1080p, try seeking the video
